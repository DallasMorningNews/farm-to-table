    <p>arm-to-table. The phrase has been around so long that it&rsquo;s on the verge of clich&eacute;. Yet the practice has only recently drawn a wider circle of home cooks around the core of early adopters. Greater availability of locally raised products has dovetailed with increased public awareness about where our food comes from and how it&rsquo;s farmed.</p>
    <p>Early on, chefs were privileged figures in the farm-to-table movement, sourcing local products that shoppers couldn&rsquo;t get. Although that&rsquo;s still the case with specialty vegetables, North Texas home cooks have more options than ever for buying a cornucopia of farm-fresh goods. Farmers markets have multiplied across North Texas in the past few years; co-ops and CSAs &mdash; community-supported agriculture groups &mdash; are also on the rise; and supermarkets have stepped up their game with more produce from Texas farms. It all adds up to bringing more mainstream cooks into the farm-to-table fold.</p>

    <p>We asked Graham Dodds, chef-owner of Wayward Sons, to share a summer menu that showcases locally sourced ingredients. Long before opening Wayward Sons, Dodds was an early supporter of local farmers and producers during his tenure as executive chef at Bolsa, and later at Hibiscus. His menu features a zesty, marinated grilled chicken dish; a dazzling ratatouille; an updated carrot salad with local goat cheese and honey; and a peach and berry cobbler that screams Texas summer.</p>
    <p>The local shopping list for Dodds&rsquo; menu includes Windy Meadows Chicken &mdash; which is famously noted on menus at many top Dallas restaurants. Like chefs, you can have the chicken delivered to your door now &mdash; or buy it at many Dallas area markets.</p>
    <p>Of course, you can&rsquo;t source every ingredient in Dodds&rsquo; recipes locally. But you can find enough of them to put a local stamp on the dishes and enjoy a quality and freshness upgrade. Read on for Dodds&rsquo; recipes and the local sources behind them &mdash; plus additional Texas sources that we tapped, including some for bread and wine.</p>

  <!-- Ratatouille recipe-->
    <div id="rata-recipe-section" class="recipe-section hide">
      <p class="recipe-intro">This seasonal special at Wayward Sons is a versatile side dish — it pairs well with poultry, fish and meats. Dodds says it can also be served as a meatless entrée, topped with crumbled ricotta salata; splurge on a crusty loaf of artisan bread to go with it.</p>

      <h4>Ingredients</h4>
      <p class="recipe-list">
        1 eggplant, cut into 3/4-inch cubes<br>
        Kosher salt, or sea salt, to taste<br>
        4 red bell peppers, cut in half, seeds removed<br>
        5 tablespoons grapeseed oil, plus more as needed (divided use)<br>
        1 medium onion, diced<br>
        2 large cloves garlic, minced<br>
        5 tomatoes, blanched, peeled and diced<br>
        2 yellow summer squash, cut into 3/4-inch cubes<br>
        2 zucchini, cut into 3/4-inch cubes<br>
        1/2 teaspoon crushed chili flakes<br>
        1 tablespoon sherry vinegar or more, to taste<br>
        1 bunch chives, thinly sliced<br>
        1/2 bunch Italian parsley, chopped<br>
        1/2 to 3/4 bunch basil, chopped
      </p>

      <h4>Directions</h4>
      <p class="recipe-copy">Preheat oven to 400 F.</p>
      <p class="recipe-copy">Toss eggplant with salt to coat and let drain in a colander for at least 30 minutes.</p>
      <p class="recipe-copy">Toss halved peppers in bowl with just enough grapeseed oil to coat (about 1 tablespoon). Season with salt to taste. Place on a sheet pan and roast in oven for 20 to 30 minutes, or until soft. Remove from oven, let sit in a bowl covered with plastic wrap for 10 minutes (to steam the skins loose). Peel off skin, and cut into large dice.</p>
      <p class="recipe-copy">In a large pot, heat 2 tablespoons of the grapeseed oil over medium heat. Add onions, sprinkle with salt, and sweat onions (sauté without browning) until translucent; if you want, you can cover the pan as they sweat, but stir them frequently. Add minced garlic and tomatoes. Cook until juices are released from the tomatoes and the mixture thickens, about 20 to 30 minutes. Add diced roasted peppers and remove from heat (may be prepared a day ahead of time and refrigerated).</p>
      <p class="recipe-copy">In a large sauté pan, heat 3 tablespoons grapeseed oil over high heat. Working in batches, add summer squash; try not to overcrowd the pan, as it prevents caramelization. Sprinkle liberally with salt. Do not shake pan, but allow single layer of squash to brown well on one side. Once browned, stir and sauté, for a minute or two to lightly cook the other sides. Remove from pan and repeat process with the zucchini and then the eggplant, still working in batches. Combine seared vegetables in the pot with the tomatoes and peppers. Bring to a simmer. Add the chili flakes, vinegar, chives, parsley and basil. Cook just until vegetables are cooked through — not too long, or they will begin to fall apart. Adjust the seasonings to taste. Serve warm.</p>
      <p class="recipe-copy">Makes 8 servings.</p>

<!-- Carrot salad recipe-->
<div id="carrot-recipe-section" class="recipe-section hide">
  <p class="recipe-intro">This salad is on the menu at Wayward Sons. Dodds says it was inspired by a carrot salad that Sharon Hage used to make at York Street and for events where the two collaborated. His addition of shishito peppers and kale makes a nice spicy and bitter counterpoint to the honey-sweetened goat cheese.</p>

  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
  <p class="recipe-list">
    24 Thumbelina (also called globe) carrots (or substitute 18-20 baby carrots), washed well and quartered (peeling is optional)<br>
    4 medium carrots (burgundy ones, if possible), peeled<br>
    1/4 cup currants<br>
    1/2 cup honey, preferably Texas Honey Bee Guild Honey (sold at Central Market), divided use<br>
    1/4 cup orange juice<br>
    12 ounces goat cheese, preferably Latte Da brand<br>
    Salt and black pepper as needed<br>
    2 tablespoons grapeseed oil, as needed<br>
    12 shishito peppers, cut into 1/2-inch pieces<br>
    1 bunch dinosaur kale leaves (also called cavolo nero or lacinato kale), stripped from the stalks and torn into bite-size pieces (or sliced 1/2-inch thick)<br>
    Champagne Vinaigrette (recipe follows)
  </p>

  <h4>Directions</h4>
  <p class="recipe-copy">Place Thumbelina carrot quarters in a large pot, cover with cold water, and salt to taste. Bring to a simmer and cook until carrots are just tender when pierced with a sharp knife — about 1 to 2 minutes, depending on size. Drain and plunge into ice bath.</p>
  <p class="recipe-copy">Use a mandoline or a very sharp knife to slice remaining carrots as thinly as possible into rounds or ovals. Place carrot slices in a bowl of ice water to crisp for 30 minutes.</p>
  <p class="recipe-copy">Remove both cooked and raw carrots from water and dry on a towel. (May be prepared ahead of time, refrigerated.)</p>
  <p class="recipe-copy">In another pot, combine currants, 1/4 cup of the honey and the orange juice and bring to a simmer. Remove from heat and let sit for 30 minutes. Strain off any unabsorbed liquid and reserve for another use. Set currants aside (may be prepared a day ahead of time).</p>
  <p class="recipe-copy">Using a mixer, combine goat cheese with remaining 1/4 cup of honey. Season with salt and black pepper to taste (may be prepared a day ahead of time).</p>
  <p class="recipe-copy">Heat a large sauté pan over medium-high heat. Coat bottom with grapeseed oil. Add shishito peppers and toss until blistered. Add kale and toss until wilted, no more than 1 minute. Put peppers and kale into bowl with carrots and plumped currants. Add champagne vinaigrette, to taste. Season with salt and black pepper. Spread goat cheese on a large serving platter in a smooth layer and place carrot mixture on top. Serve immediately.</p>
  <p class="recipe-copy"><strong>Champagne Vinaigrette:</strong> In a bowl, whisk together 1 1/2 tablespoons champagne vinegar and 4 to 4 1/2 tablespoons olive oil, to taste. Add salt, to taste.</p>
  <p class="recipe-copy">Makes 6 to 8 servings.</p>
