<!-- intro copy -->
	<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">F</span><p>arm-to-table. The phrase has been around so long that it&rsquo;s on the verge of clich&eacute;. Yet the practice has only recently drawn a wider circle of home cooks around the core of early adopters. Greater availability of locally raised products has dovetailed with increased public awareness about where our food comes from and how it&rsquo;s farmed.</p>

    <p>Early on, chefs were privileged figures in the farm-to-table movement, sourcing local products that shoppers couldn&rsquo;t get. Although that&rsquo;s still the case with specialty vegetables, North Texas home cooks have more options than ever for buying a cornucopia of farm-fresh goods. Farmers markets have multiplied across north Texas in the past few years; co-ops and CSAs &mdash; community supported agriculture groups &mdash; are also on the rise; and supermarkets have stepped up their game with more produce from Texas farms. It all adds up to bringing more mainstream cooks into the farm-to-table fold.</p>

    <p>We asked Graham Dodds, chef-owner of Wayward Sons, to share a summer menu that showcases locally sourced ingredients. Long before opening Wayward Sons, Dodds was an early supporter of local farmers and producers during his tenure as executive chef at Bolsa, and later at Hibiscus. His menu features a zesty, marinated grilled chicken dish; a dazzling ratatouille; an updated carrot salad with local goat cheese and honey; and a peach and berry cobbler that screams Texas summer.</p>

    <p>The local shopping list for Dodds&rsquo; menu includes Windy Meadows Chicken &mdash; which is famously noted on menus at many top Dallas restaurants. Like chefs, you can have the chicken delivered to your door now &mdash; or buy it at many Dallas area markets.</p>

    <p>Of course, you can&rsquo;t source every ingredient in Dodds&rsquo; recipes locally. But you can find enough of them to put a local stamp on the dishes and enjoy a quality and freshness upgrade. Read on for Dodds&rsquo; recipes and the local sources behind them &mdash; plus additional sources that we tapped, including some for bread and wine.</p>

    <h4>Squash and eggplant</h4>
    <h5>Comeback Creek Farm | Co Rd 2119, Pittsburg, TX 75686</h5>
    <p class="origin-copy">Dodds is among the chefs supporting this farm, but home cooks can too. You can buy a variety of seasonal vegetables through the farm’s Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program (sign up at comebackcreek.com). Farm-share memberships are available for the year (summer, fall and spring), or just one season; choose your pick-up site: Deep Ellum, Richardson or Coppell. </p>

    <h4>Tomatoes</h4>
    <h5>J.T. Lemley’s Tomatoes | 590 VZ County Rd 2143, Canton, TX 75103</h5>
    <p class="origin-copy">We like the tomatoes that this popular Canton farmer sells at the Dallas Farmers Market on Saturdays, in a stall on the north side of the shed.</p>

    <h4>Herbs</h4>
    <h5>Herbco Texas, previously known as Generation Farms | 1109 N McKinney St, Rice, TX 75155 | herbco.net</h5>
    <p>This certified organic herb farm supplies herbs to many Dallas-area supermarkets, sometimes under the store’s private label.

  <h4>Chicken</h4>
  <h5>Windy Meadows Chicken | Windy Meadows Chicken, Campbell, Texas</h5>
  <p class="origin-copy">Windy Meadows Family Farm raises all-natural chickens, bred on-site. The chickens are hatched in a cage-free environment and raised as free-range chickens in a pastured environment, which unlike commercial chicken farms, means lots of sun and fresh air. The chicken enjoys a great reputation among the local chef community.

  <h4>Honey</h4>
  <h5>Texas Honeybee Guild Honey | Blackland Prairie, Texas</h5>
  <p class="origin-copy">This organization (txbeeguild.org) owns and operates over 200 honeybee colonies throughout North Texas’ Blackland Prairie. In addition to the Blackland Prairie honey, the guild also makes hyper-local ZIP code honey, sourced mostly from Dallas neighborhoods. The honey is sold at Dallas Farmers Market, Good Local Markets and Central Market.</p>

  <h4>Goat Cheese</h4>
  <h5>Latte Da Dairy | 1304 Bridle Bit Rd, Flower Mound, TX 75022</h5>
  <p class="origin-copy">Latte Da Dairy (lattedadairy.com) raises Nubian and LaMancha goats on its farm to produce a variety of artisan goat milk cheeses. The dairy farm offers an open house in the fall for those who want to visit. The cheese is sold at Central Market, Scardello Artisan Cheese (Farmers Market location), Coppell Farmers Market, and Good Local Market (Lakeside location).</p>

  <h4>Thumbelina/globe carrots, burgundy carrots and kale</h4>
  <h5>Tassione Farms | 807 County Road 466, Stephenville, TX</h5>
  <p class="origin-copy">Beloved by chefs, Rocky Tassione provides restaurants with hard-to-find specialty produce, year-round. Since everything that he grows is dedicated to restaurant chefs, we bought organic kale and carrots from Whole Foods Market to use in Dodds’ salad recipe.</p>

<h4>Blueberries and blackberries</h4>
<h5>Blueberry Basket | 12462 FM 315, Larue, TX 75770 | 903-677-3448</h5>
<p class="origin-copy">This East Texas farm sells organic blueberries and blackberries to many local stores and markets, and welcomes visitors to come and pick their own berries.

<p class="origin-copy">This farm has over 10,000 trees with 30 varieties of peaches, which are sold at Coppell Farmers Market, Good Local Markets and Central Market. The farm also lets you pick your own.</p>
<h5>Cooper Farms | 301 I-45 Exit 198, Fairfield, TX 75840 | cooperpeaches.com</h5>
<p class="origin-copy">Cooper Farms peaches are sold at Central Market and at the farm’s store on I-45 in Fairfield, if you happen to be driving by

<h4>Meyer Lemon Rosemary Bread</h4>
<h5>Village Baking Company | 5531 E University Blvd, Dallas, TX 75206 | villagebakingco.com</h5>
<p class="origin-copy">This is one of our favorites. It’s especially good brushed with olive oil and grilled. If you want to be decadent, spread it with some Latte Da goat cheese.</p>

<h4>Kiepersol Estate Texas Syrah, 2012</h4>
<h5>Kiepersol | 3933 FM 344 E, Tyler, TX 75703 | kiepersol.com</h5>
<p class="origin-copy">This medium bodied wine’s jammy fruit and soft tannins make it a good fit for the spicy chicken and the tomato-rich ratatouille. It has just enough body to stand up to the chicken but doesn’t overwhelm it.</p>
