<!-- intro copy -->
	<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">F</span><p>arm-to-table. The phrase has been around so long that it&rsquo;s on the verge of clich&eacute;. Yet the practice has only recently drawn a wider circle of home cooks around the core of early adopters. Greater availability of locally raised products has dovetailed with increased public awareness about where our food comes from and how it&rsquo;s farmed.</p>

    <p>Early on, chefs were privileged figures in the farm-to-table movement, sourcing local products that shoppers couldn&rsquo;t get. Although that&rsquo;s still the case with specialty vegetables, North Texas home cooks have more options than ever for buying a cornucopia of farm-fresh goods. Farmers markets have multiplied across north Texas in the past few years; co-ops and CSAs &mdash; community supported agriculture groups &mdash; are also on the rise; and supermarkets have stepped up their game with more produce from Texas farms. It all adds up to bringing more mainstream cooks into the farm-to-table fold.</p>

    <p>We asked Graham Dodds, chef-owner of Wayward Sons, to share a summer menu that showcases locally sourced ingredients. Long before opening Wayward Sons, Dodds was an early supporter of local farmers and producers during his tenure as executive chef at Bolsa, and later at Hibiscus. His menu features a zesty, marinated grilled chicken dish; a dazzling ratatouille; an updated carrot salad with local goat cheese and honey; and a peach and berry cobbler that screams Texas summer.</p>

    <p>The local shopping list for Dodds&rsquo; menu includes Windy Meadows Chicken &mdash; which is famously noted on menus at many top Dallas restaurants. Like chefs, you can have the chicken delivered to your door now &mdash; or buy it at many Dallas area markets.</p>

    <p>Of course, you can&rsquo;t source every ingredient in Dodds&rsquo; recipes locally. But you can find enough of them to put a local stamp on the dishes and enjoy a quality and freshness upgrade. Read on for Dodds&rsquo; recipes and the local sources behind them &mdash; plus additional sources that we tapped, including some for bread and wine.</p>

You can buy a variety of seasonal vegetables through the farm’s Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program (sign up at comebackcreek.com). Farm-share memberships are available for the year (summer, fall and spring), or just one season; choose your pick-up site: Deep Ellum, Richardson or Coppell. </p>

  <!-- Ratatouille recipe-->
    <div id="rata-recipe-section" class="recipe-section hide">
      <p class="recipe-intro">This seasonal special at Wayward Sons is a versatile side dish — it pairs well with poultry, fish, and meats. Dodds says it can also be served as a meatless entrée, topped with crumbled ricotta salata; splurge on a crusty loaf of artisan bread to go with it.</p>

      <h4>Ingredients</h4>
      <p class="recipe-list">
        1 eggplant, cut into 3/4-inch cubes<br>
        Kosher salt, or sea salt, to taste<br>
        4 red bell peppers, cut in half, seeds removed<br>
        5 tablespoons grapeseed oil, plus more as needed (divided use)<br>
        1 medium onion, diced<br>
        2 large cloves garlic, minced<br>
        5 tomatoes, blanched, peeled and diced<br>
        2 yellow summer squash, cut into 3/4-inch cubes<br>
        2 zucchini, cut into 3/4-inch cubes<br>
        1/2 teaspoon crushed chili flakes<br>
        1 tablespoon sherry vinegar or more, to taste<br>
        1 bunch chives, thinly sliced<br>
        1/2 bunch Italian parsley, chopped<br>
        1/2 to 3/4 bunch basil, chopped<br>
      </p>

      <h4>Directions</h4>
      <p class="recipe-copy">Preheat oven to 400 F.</p>
      <p class="recipe-copy">Toss eggplant with salt to coat and let drain in a colander for at least 30 minutes.</p>
      <p class="recipe-copy">Toss halved peppers in bowl with just enough grapeseed oil to coat (about 1 tablespoon). Season with salt to taste. Place on a sheet pan and roast in oven for 20 to 30 minutes, or until soft. Remove from oven, let sit in a bowl covered with plastic wrap for 10 minutes (to steam the skins loose). Peel off skin, and cut into large dice.</p>
      <p class="recipe-copy">In a large pot, heat 2 tablespoons of the grapeseed oil over medium heat. Add onions, sprinkle with salt, and sweat onions (saut&eacute; without browning) until translucent; if you want, you can cover the pan as they sweat, but stir them frequently. Add minced garlic and tomatoes. Cook until juices are released from the tomatoes and the mixture thickens, about 20 to 30 minutes. Add diced roasted peppers and remove from heat (may be prepared a day ahead of time and refrigerated).</p>
      <p class="recipe-copy">In a large saut&eacute; pan, heat 3 tablespoons grapeseed oil over high heat. Working in batches, add summer squash; try not to overcrowd the pan, as it prevents caramelization. Sprinkle liberally with salt. Do not shake pan, but allow single layer of squash to brown well on one side. Once browned, stir and saut&eacute;, for a minute or two to lightly cook the other sides. Remove from pan and repeat process with the zucchini and then the eggplant, still working in batches. Combine seared vegetables in the pot with the tomatoes and peppers. Bring to a simmer. Add the chili flakes, vinegar, chives, parsley and basil. Cook just until vegetables are cooked through &mdash; not too long, or they will begin to fall apart. Adjust the seasonings to taste. Serve warm.</p>
      <p class="recipe-copy">Makes 8 servings.</p>

  <h4>Chicken</h4>
  <h5>Windy Meadows Chicken | Windy Meadows Chicken, Campbell, Texas</h5>
  <p class="origins-copy">Windy Meadows Family Farm raises all-natural chickens, bred on-site. The chickens are hatched in a cage-free environment and raised as free-range chickens in a pastured environment, which unlike commercial chicken farms, means lots of sun and fresh air. The chicken enjoys a great reputation among the local chef community.

  <!-- Jerry's recipe-->
  <div class="recipe-section hide">
    <p class="recipe-intro">Dodds gives credit for this chicken recipe to one of his line cooks at Hibiscus, who occasionally made it for the restaurant staff’s meal before service. “It was always crazy delicious. We called it magic chicken because it is so good, so juicy, and the spice rub so delicious, that everyone would be in a really good mood after they ate it,” Dodds says.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <p class="recipe-list">
      2 whole Windy Meadows chickens, cut into parts; or 4 bone-in breast halves and 4 leg and thigh quarters, also from Windy Meadows<br>
      1/4 cup granulated onion<br>
      1/4 cup granulated garlic<br>
      1/4 cup black pepper, coarsely ground<br>
      1/8 cup crushed red pepper flakes<br>
      1/8 cup kosher salt<br>
      1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley<br>
      1/4 cup chopped fresh rosemary<br>
      2 lemons<br>
      2 limes<br>
      2 oranges
    </p>

    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <p class="recipe-copy">Place chicken parts in a large, nonreactive bowl. In a separate bowl, combine the granulated onion, granulated garlic, black and red peppers, parsley and rosemary. Rub the chicken evenly with the spice mixture. Squeeze juice from the lemons, limes and oranges into a small bowl to combine; pour juice evenly over chicken to coat it. Cover and marinate overnight in the refrigerator.</p>
    <p class="recipe-copy">Pre-heat grill to medium-hot. Brush the grill grate clean. Using tongs, oil the grill grate with a wad of paper towels dipped in vegetable oil. Grill chicken, skin-side down, for about 10 minutes (watch for flare-ups). Turn chicken to the other side and cook for another 10 minutes (8 to 10 minutes for breasts).</p>
    <p class="recipe-copy">If breasts are done, remove them and keep warm. If not, move them to a cool part of the grill and continue cooking until done. Move leg and thigh quarters to cooler part of the grill. Cover grill and cook, turning once, until done (about 20 to 25 more minutes); the chicken is done when the juices run clear as the tip of a skewer or a sharp knife is inserted in the thickest part of a thigh. (If you are cooking over coals, they may burn down before the chicken is done; if you don&rsquo;t want to replenish them, you can finish cooking the chicken in a 350 F oven.)</p>
    <p class="recipe-copy">Transfer chicken to a serving platter and serve immediately.</p>
    <p class="recipe-copy">Makes 8 to 10 servings.</p>

  <p class="recipe-copy">Place chicken parts in a large, nonreactive bowl. In a separate bowl, combine the granulated onion, granulated garlic, black and red peppers, parsley and rosemary. Rub the chicken evenly with the spice mixture. Squeeze juice from the lemons, limes and oranges into a small bowl to combine; pour juice evenly over chicken to coat it. Cover and marinate overnight in the refrigerator.</p>
  <p class="recipe-copy">Pre-heat grill to medium-hot. Brush the grill grate clean. Using tongs, oil the grill grate with a wad of paper towels dipped in vegetable oil. Grill chicken, skin-side down, for about 10 minutes (watch for flare-ups). Turn chicken to the other side and cook for another 10 minutes (8 to 10 minutes for breasts).</p>
  <p class="recipe-copy">If breasts are done, remove them and keep warm. If not, move them to a cool part of the grill and continue cooking until done. Move leg and thigh quarters to cooler part of the grill. Cover grill and cook, turning once, until done (about 20 to 25 more minutes); the chicken is done when the juices run clear as the tip of a skewer or a sharp knife is inserted in the thickest part of a thigh. (If you are cooking over coals, they may burn down before the chicken is done; if you don&rsquo;t want to replenish them, you can finish cooking the chicken in a 350 F oven.)</p>
  <p class="recipe-copy">Transfer chicken to a serving platter and serve immediately.</p>
  <p class="recipe-copy">Makes 8 to 10 servings.</p>

    <h4>Honey</h4>
    <h5>Texas Honeybee Guild Honey | Blackland Prairie, Texas</h5>
    <p class="origins-copy">This organization (txbeeguild.org) owns and operates over 200 honeybee colonies throughout North Texas’ Blackland Prairie. In addition to the Blackland Prairie honey, the guild also makes hyper-local ZIP code honey, sourced mostly from Dallas neighborhoods. The honey is sold at Dallas Farmers Market, Good Local Markets and Central Market.</p>

    <h4>Goat Cheese</h4>
    <h5>Latte Da Dairy | 1304 Bridle Bit Rd, Flower Mound, TX 75022</h5>
    <p class="origins-copy">Latte Da Dairy (lattedadairy.com) raises Nubian and LaMancha goats on its farm to produce a variety of artisan goat milk cheeses. The dairy farm offers an open house in the fall for those who want to visit. The cheese is sold at Central Market, Scardello Artisan Cheese (Farmers Market location), Coppell Farmers Market, and Good Local Market (Lakeside location).</p>

    <h4>Thumbelina/globe carrots, burgundy carrots and kale</h4>
    <h5>Tassione Farms | 807 County Road 466, Stephenville, TX</h5>
    <p class="origins-copy">Beloved by chefs, Rocky Tassione provides restaurants with hard-to-find specialty produce, year-round. Since everything that he grows is dedicated to restaurant chefs, we bought organic kale and carrots from Whole Foods Market to use in Dodds’ salad recipe.</p>

    <p class="recipe-intro">Dodds gives credit for this chicken recipe to one of his line cooks at Hibiscus, who occasionally made it for the restaurant staff’s meal before service. “It was always crazy delicious. We called it magic chicken because it is so good, so juicy, and the spice rub so delicious, that everyone would be in a really good mood after they ate it,” Dodds says.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <p class="recipe-list">
      2 whole Windy Meadows chickens, cut into parts; or 4 bone-in breast halves and 4 leg and thigh quarters, also from Windy Meadows<br>
      1/4 cup granulated onion<br>
      1/4 cup granulated garlic<br>
      1/4 cup black pepper, coarsely ground<br>
      1/8 cup crushed red pepper flakes<br>
      1/8 cup kosher salt<br>
      1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley<br>
      1/4 cup chopped fresh rosemary<br>

<!-- peach recipe -->

 This salad is on the menu at Wayward Sons. Dodds says it was inspired by a carrot salad that Sharon Hage used to make at York Street and for events where the two collaborated. His addition of shishito peppers and kale makes a nice spicy and bitter counterpoint to the honey sweetened goat cheese.
